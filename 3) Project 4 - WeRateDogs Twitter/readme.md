# Project 4: WeRateDogs Twitter
This project is part of a requirement to graduate in the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND).
It provides the opportunity to implement Data Wrangling in practice by gathering data from different sources, assessing it for quality and tidiness issues and then promote the necessary cleaning task - programmatically.


**Data Wrangling** is an essential skill for Data Science since you cannot have advanced Machine Learning modeling techniques built on top of "messy data".
It can be divided into 3 main tasks:

1. **Gather**: acquiring/collecting data and importing that data into your programming environment. (i.e. downloading a file, scraping a web page, querying an API)
2. **Asses**: evaluate data quality and tidiness, identifying what needs fixing.  
3. **Clean**: actions to be taken, according to the previous data assessment, to improve data quality and make the structure properly tidy. Using the Define -> Code -> Test framework.

## Key Findings
**Q1)** The Top 5 Most common dog names: 1) Oliver, 2) Daisy, 3) Cooper, 4) Lucy, 5) Sadie


**Q2)** The Top 5 most common dog breeds: 1) Golden Retriever, 2) Pembroke, 3) Labrador, 4) Chihuahua, 5) Pug


**Q3)** The top 5 most liked dog breeds - which lead to an ugly truth: 
> The majority of people love *huge-clumsy-goofy-looking* dogs! ðŸ˜‚

**Q4)** Evaluation of the time component of tweets/posts: November through March being the months with higher than average # of posts, having Wednesdays and Thursdays as the busiest days of the week.

 As well as a diminishing trends of posts per day, along the time, since the start of the Channel (moving average of 7 days).

Lastly, and most important... this project would not be complete without a smile:
